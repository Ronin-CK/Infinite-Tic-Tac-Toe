## ✨ Features

* **The "Rule of 3":** No more draws. Each player can only have **3 pieces** on the board at once. Placing a 4th piece causes your oldest one to disappear.
* **Modern Visuals:**
    * **Glassmorphism:** Translucent cards with background blur and noise textures.
    * **Dynamic Animations:** Floating background orbs, pulsing active pieces, and pop animations for new moves.
* **Smart Indicators:** The game highlights your oldest piece (the one about to vanish) by dimming it, helping you strategize your next move.
* **Lightweight:** Zero dependencies—just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Place your X or O:** Standard rules apply—try to align 3 in a row.
2.  **Watch the Limit:** You only have **3** pieces available.
3.  **The Twist:** Once you place your **4th** piece, your **1st (oldest)** piece disappears from the board.
4.  **Strategy:** You cannot place a new piece on the exact spot where your old piece is vanishing.
